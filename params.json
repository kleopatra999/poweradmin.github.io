{"name":"Poweradmin","tagline":"A web-based control panel for PowerDNS","body":"## Welcome to Poweradmin!\r\n\r\n### A friendly web interface for PowerDNS\r\n\r\nPoweradmin is a friendly web-based DNS administration tool for [Bert Hubert's](http://ds9a.nl/) [PowerDNS](http://www.powerdns.com/) server. The interface has full support for most of the features of PowerDNS. It has full support for all zone types ( [master](http://downloads.powerdns.com/documentation/html/master.html),  [native](http://downloads.powerdns.com/documentation/html/replication.html#native-replication) and  [slave](http://downloads.powerdns.com/documentation/html/slave.html)), for  supermasters for automatic provisioning of slave zones, full support for IPv6 and comes with multi-language support. See [feature list](https://www.poweradmin.org/trac/wiki/Features) for all features.\r\n\r\nThis version of Poweradmin is an adapation of the Poweradmin that was written by Jorn Ekkelenkamp and Roeland Nieuwenhuis a few years ago. The current version has been extended with numerous features that were missing in the original code and has considerable performance improvements. We also removed the \"sequence updater\" and replaced the database abstract layer code. We are now working hard in getting the basic setup right. As soon as all functionality is fixed, we will start working on the interface itself, improving it's useability and make it more attractive.\r\n\r\nPoweradmin is released under a [GPL license](http://www.fsf.org/licensing). Most recent version is [2.1.6](https://www.poweradmin.org/trac/wiki/GettingPoweradmin). \r\n\r\n### News\r\n* Subscribe to our news feed on [Identi.ca](http://identi.ca/poweradmin) (May 11th, 2012)\r\n* Poweradmin [2.1.6 released](https://www.poweradmin.org/trac/wiki/News/Poweradmin2.1.6Released) (May 7th, 2012)\r\n\r\n### Further reading\r\n* have a look at the [feature list](https://www.poweradmin.org/trac/wiki/Features)\r\n* [download](https://www.poweradmin.org/trac/wiki/GettingPoweradmin) and [install](https://www.poweradmin.org/trac/wiki/Documentation/Install) a complete(r) poweradmin\r\n* we have just started on the [documentation](https://www.poweradmin.org/trac/wiki/Documentation)\r\n* check the [roadmap](https://www.poweradmin.org/trac) to see what is upcoming: milestones [2.1.7](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/issues?milestone=2&state=open)\r\n* see a list of [known bugs](https://www.poweradmin.org/trac/report/9), the [wishlist](https://www.poweradmin.org/trac/report/10) or [tasks](https://www.poweradmin.org/trac/report/11)\r\n* try it, use the [demo](https://www.poweradmin.org/trac/wiki/Demo)\r\n* stay tuned: [mailinglists](https://www.poweradmin.org/trac/wiki/Mailinglists) and [irc](https://www.poweradmin.org/trac/wiki/Irc)\r\n* or report a bug to the [ticketing system](https://github.com/poweradmin/poweradmin/issues)\r\n* help is [highly appreciated](https://www.poweradmin.org/trac/wiki/Credits)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
